[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lyricsgenius.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lyricsgenius/)

## Setup
This repository is intended to provide an easy interface for programatically accessing the song information stored on [Genius.com](https://www.genius.com). Check out [my blog post](http://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/) for a more thorough description of the package and its usage.

To use the Genius API you'll need to sign up for a (free) client that authorizes you to [access their API](http://genius.com/api-clients). You'll need to supply your `client_access_token` from Genius when using this module. See [Usage](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius#usage) below for an example.

## Installation
*LyricsGenius* requires Python 3.

The easiest way to use this package is to install it via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lyricsgenius) using `pip`:

`$pip install lyricsgenius`

If you'd prefer to clone the repository and install it yourself, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo:  
`$git clone https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git`
2. Enter the directory created:  
`$cd LyricsGenius`
3. Install using pip:  
`$pip install .`

## Usage
```python
>>> import lyricsgenius as genius
>>> api = genius.Genius('my_client_access_token_here')
>>> artist = api.search_artist('Andy Shauf', max_songs=3)
Searching for Andy Shauf...

Song 1: "Alexander All Alone"
Song 2: "Begin Again"
Song 3: "Comfortable With Silence"

Reached user-specified song limit (3).
Found 3 songs.

Done.
>>> print(artist)
Andy Shauf, 3 songs
>>> song = api.search_song('To You',artist.name)
Searching for "To You" by Andy Shauf...
Done.
>>> print(song)
"To You" by Andy Shauf:
    Jeremy can we talk a minute
    I've got some things that I need to
    Get off of my chestI know that we h...
>>> artist.add_song(song)
>>> print(artist)
Andy Shauf, 4 songs
>>> artist.save_lyrics() # Saves artist's lyrics to a JSON file
```

You can also call the package from the command line. When ran from the command line, the package expects to find an environment variable with your Genius client access token.
```
$export GENIUS_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN="my_client_access_token_here"
$python3 -m lyricsgenius --search-song 'Begin Again' 'Andy Shauf'
$python3 -m lyricsgenius --search-artist 'Lupe Fiasco' 3
```
